The Respectful Public Library Lending License

The RPL3 License, v1.00						v:MjhBdWcxMg==


The software licensed hereunder, large or small, is primarily meant to serve as a 
function library, API (Application Programming Interface), or collection of discrete 
components and logic that, while potentially individually useful, do not culminate 
to comprise a typical program or product in its own right and is inherently designed 
to be used by many in its exposed, accessible form. Consequently, the spirit of this license 
differs from that of other licenses which typically cover holistic applications, 
chiefly because the authors of software libraries, components, snippets, and utilities
that are librarylike more often undertake these projects to be useful rather than to personally profit.

The contributing organization, author, or authors of this software, most likely
intrinsically motivated by either a quest for validation or what will hereafter 
be referred to as "warm fuzzies", are making a sort of conditional bequest to 
the community at large.

Redistribution and use of this library in source and binary forms is
permitted provided that the following conditions are met: 

1. Duty Not To (Overly) Fold, Spindle, or Mutilate. 
To the extent possible, the library source file remain relatively intact.
The nature of a software library means that its proliferation and reputation
(and potentially that of its author) may suffer unfairly when its reliability 
is judged not upon the actual work, but upon impressions derived from experiences
with copies containing untested, ad-hoc, and often purpose-built "patches" over
original or multiply-mutated work. There are some situations in which 
these modifications are typically more welcome than others.

While you are under no license obligation in this area, mostly this is a question of respect:

If the software in which you are planning to leverage this library's functionality
is distributed mostly in binary form and doesn't blatantly advertise its reliance
on the library, feel empowered (because you are) to modify even the core source files of the library 
to the bounds of your heart's desire. Sometimes the performance need comes along to take only a
subset of the software to use with a larger program being written, and that's a need that should
be respected.

If you are merely passing the software along, especially in source form, you would do
well not to modify it. If you have any technical suggestions, try to get in contact with
the author, who will most likely graciously recieve your input.

( Speaking of that, by <deity>, you are well within your rights (as always, where your country doesn't forbid it)
to reverse engineer any library covered under this license, though if that grant makes any real sense
in this context, this work probably isn't very much of a library. )

In general, where you make modifications, it is courteous and expected of you to provide
some sort of changelog in addition to retaining the original source file notice that clearly
demarcates your work vs. the authors.

2. No Trolls, No Plagiarists
You may not pass the work off as your own.
You may not attempt to claim copyright of the work to prevent others from using it. 

In fact, you may not claim copyright of the work at all.

This applies to the whole as well as the parts. When distributing it or any portions in source form,
you are required to make some proper and visible attribution of its authorship and are very much 
encouraged to retain, unmodified, the original notices and documentation in at least the
source files themselves, if not necessarily (unless expressly requested by the author)
the outlying documentation and license files, since requirements entailing the retention
of various readmes and such can tend to be messy, vague, and onerous. If you use the library
as a part of a work you create and distribute only in binary form, it is not required of you that
you reproduce the notices, but it would be very nice if you could give credit for the free libraries
you use because learning that a library is being used "by someone else" and "in the real world" tends
very much to spur their otherwise sometimes thankless development.

3. Commercial Use. You may not sell the library itself as a product. You really shouldn't 
burn it onto a disk that will be sold in an office supply store bargain bin as 
"1001 Free Software Libraries". If you are in the business of hosting collections of free
software libraries to which you allow access for a monthly subscription charge, you are probably
in the wrong business and clearly missed the fact that you could likely make much more charging
extortionate rates to institutions and unaffiliated individuals for the same sort of access
to academic journal articles for the same sort of effort.
  
You are at liberty, however, at great liberty in fact, 
to include the library in source and especially in binary form in conjunction
with a product that you sell or distribute. 

That's right. You can use it in a commercial setting (an office, mayhap)
and pay no royalties, even though you're making money and not 
a home or educational user. For this covered work, the author has chosen
not to discriminate on the basis of who you are.

Basically, commercial use of the product is allowed so long as
the product itself does not become an item of commerce. 

For programmers, since the library author is probably not totally unlike yourself,
he or she ESPECIALLY WANTS you to hear, read, understand, or otherwise NOT MISS OUT
on the following, because it is sometimes tragically unclear in other licenses.

Within the guidelines and (quite roomy) confines of this license and any others that may accompany it,
unless those supersede these:

		* You are ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED to DYNAMICALLY 
		  (at runtime) LINK to this software!

		* You are ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED to STATICALLY
		  (at compiletime) LINK to this software!

		* IF YOU WRITE A PROGRAM that interfaces with this software 
			   in nearly any conceivable way,
                  you STILL have all of the rights to your part of the
                  program, and you don't have to give it, or its source
	          away to anybody or maintain it as a museum piece 
                  or something, as would seem to be mandated in 
		  certain other sprawling, more than vaguely 
                  idealistic free software licenses.

4. Prohibited Use Is Prohibited

You are not allowed to use this software in any jurisdiction where its use is disallowed.
It's not the author's fault if you find yourself in front of a firing squad, or languishing
in a malaria-infested tropical prison or even routinely detained at the border for questioning. 
If your government doesn't want you using this software library because they consider 
it nefarious or emasculating, do yourself a favor and either don't use it or find yourself
a different government (unless of course they happen to frown upon that too).

5. Don't Harass the Authors ("Love it or Lump It")

Most likely, the authors released their efforts to public scrutiny because they 
were feeling sincerely giving and magnanimous, and wished productivity on another
suffering human soul. Your use of the software obligates you not to harass the authors
in connection with their work on the program. Beyond not sending excessive fanmail,
you agree not to berate the authors even in the face of incompetence, or use their
failings, mistakes, oversights, and accidents as munitions for campaigns of public
disgrace and humiliation. You also agree not to use the name of the authors or their creations,
or any personal details to promote your own program or business, even if it leverages the library. 
In general, too much publicity can be bad publicity.

Because some of us live in an excessively and increasingly litigious society,
there is one more very important group of assertions you must agree to before you
are permitted to use the software. Even though the text may be very familiar, 
library authors especially, really need these protections and we hope you will
take this commitment seriously.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND
ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;
LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Even at the library level, software's successful and expected operation is
dependent on the sucessful and expected reliable operation of many systems,
conditions, and realities it relies upon that may not be "future-proof" or
even "present-proof", and one of these, significantly, is the ever-fallible
human brain. Therefore we must ask, especially since the author is providing
the software with no expectation of direct financial gain, that you agree not 
to undertake legal action against him, her, or them or anyone associated with 
them in connection with anyone's use of the program.
